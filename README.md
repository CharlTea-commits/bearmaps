This is one of my favorite school projects to date! Most back-end Java code was written by me and my partner. Front-end was provided beforehand.

We implemented rasterizing, turn-by-turn navigation, auto-complete searching, and more. We were given a front-end to understand and work with, which required us to think about the time and space complexities of our program every step of the way.
